# Polymer to Vue.js Migration Task

In the sub-directory "polymer", you'll find a little web application implemented in the legacy web technology
[Polymer V1](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/). It contains a Web Component called 
`number-selector`. Your task is to rewrite the component in Vue3 so that the new component implements all the features,
the old component contains. For this task, feel free to use the Vue project located in the subdirectory `vue`.

Unfortunately, there is no specification of `number-selector` in the legacy code base, hence you have to reverse
engineer the component. Feel free to search on the web, in the Polymer docs or try the component out by yourself by
running the dev server with `cd polymer && npm install && npm start`.
